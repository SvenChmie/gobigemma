We had to say goodbye to Big Mama again. I told Sven _I don’t want to say goodbye to Big Mama!_ But then he said, _But Big Emma, you get to meet even more people soon, and that will be really special!_

And he was right! Sven’s family came to visit us in Mexico! I’ve only ever met [Emma’s family](/gobigemma/2017/08/04/119-look-emmas-parents-came-see) and [Annika](/gobigemma/2017/04/28/77-new-friend-annika-like-old-friend) and [Philipp](/gobigemma/2017/01/23/40-went-new-human-phil-desert) and [Buddy](/gobigemma/2017/01/11/35-thats-buddy), but never Sven’s family! I was so excited because I think Sven was right and I told him, _You’re right Sven this is really special!_

We got along really well! I love Sven’s family! They said they wanted to do something fun for me, so they made us all a German _breakfast_ with a thing called [Brötchen](/gobigemma/2017/02/16/popular-questions-hablamos-espanol). I was so happy that they made it I didn’t tell them that [I don’t like _breakfast_, I only like gas](/gobigemma/2017/06/23/101-look-im-eating-breakfast).
