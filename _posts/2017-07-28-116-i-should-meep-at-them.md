I really like this cactus garden. Not only is it pretty, Sven and Emma really like it here. They like it because there is a lot of nature and because there are not very many other humans around like there are in cities. The only thing I think they didn’t like was when Sven stepped on a cactus.

And at night it is especially quiet. The only sounds are the animals making their little animal noises and sometimes the wind. But then it was the _weekend_ and everything was different! The _weekend_ is a special time when humans work less and like to be louder, although I don’t understand why.

But they are definitely louder! We were sleeping here and it was very quiet and peaceful but then humans came and rented a house over there for the weekend and they played music the whole night long! And they kept yelling _Chug_ and Emma and Sven were really annoyed. I told them I could go _MEEP_ at them for a very long time so they would stop being annoying but Sven said I couldn’t do that so they just kept being loud. The _weekend_ is stupid.
