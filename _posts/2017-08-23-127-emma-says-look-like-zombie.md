Emma said I look like a _Zombie_. So I asked her _Why do I look like a Zombie?_ And she said that was because my light was hanging out the front weirdly.

So I asked her _What’s a Zombie?_ and she said a _Zombie_ is a human who is supposed to be dead. So I asked her _What is dead?_ She said that’s what happens to humans when they don’t work right anymore. It’s like when they take cars to the junk yard. _What happens to Zombies?_ I asked her. Emma said they look really ugly and disgusting and people don’t like them.

I don’t want to be ugly or disgusting at all! Or dead! I told her to clean my light faster and put it back in because I didn’t want anybody to think I was a _Zombie_!
