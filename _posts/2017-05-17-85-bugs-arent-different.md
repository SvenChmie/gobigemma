This is my new friend. He's a Bug.

Emma said Bugs are kind of like [family](/gobigemma/2017/03/10/60-my-family) for buses, because they are very similar. _Well_, I said, _they have almost the same engine, but I don't think we're that similar other than that. Especially because this Bug is from Mexico_. And I told her _I don't think we were made in the same factory and we never lived together, so I don't understand how we could be family._ 

But I did get to park next to the Bug at this lovely farm for a whole weekend, and we got to talking. And guess what? We do have a lot in common! He likes roads and being washed and driving around Baja and all kinds of other stuff, just like me! I told Emma, _I don't think we're family, but we are definitely friends!_

Bugs aren't as strange as I thought they'd be!
