_You know we’ll always take care of you, Big Emma, right?_ Sven told me yesterday while we were parked. _Yeah_, I said.

We parked next to a place with a lot of monkeys and we could listen to them while we watched the sunset. _But what if I ever break and you can’t fix me?_ I asked Sven. He said, _Well, we’ll always try to make sure you don’t break that much. You’re strong, Big Emma, you won’t break that easily._ And I said, _Yeah_.

_And I’ll take care of you, too, just in case you break,_ I told Sven. _Thank you, Big Emma, he said, you already take care of us. You do all the driving and camping_. I thought about that for a while and watched more of the sunset. _Yeah, I told him, but I don’t want you to break. That would be the worst_ and then Sven smiled.
