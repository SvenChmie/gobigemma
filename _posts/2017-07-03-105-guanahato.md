This is a city called Guanahato. It is beautiful! I told you it would be great to be back on the road!

It is beautiful because there are so many houses that are colorful like me! And I get to park here on this hillside and look at them all, and I blend in because I am beautiful and colorful, too!

And Emma and Sven aren’t sleeping in a stupid house anymore, they are camping with me, just like they should be. The world is correct again. Whew.
