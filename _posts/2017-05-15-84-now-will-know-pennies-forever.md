I got so many new pennies for [my penny collection](/gobigemma/2017/04/26/76-penny-collection)! Look how many I have now!

My friend [Ben](https://www.instagram.com/hastaalaska/) gave them to me. He has a Bus too, named Co'Pito. I know his Bus from way [back up in Alaska](/gobigemma/2016/10/06/vanlifers-fellow-travelers-friends-family). But his Bus doesn't like to be called a _Bus_, it likes to be called a _Kombi_ (that's another word in Spanish, it means _Bus_).

Ben gave me all sorts of new _pesos_ because he and Co'Pito have _already been_ all the way to Argentina! So now I'm well prepared and I know all about all of the pennies on the way so I will always know if I'm going the right way to Argentina. Thank you, Ben!
