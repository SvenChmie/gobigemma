Look I’m surfing! They made this wave here on the street so Buses like me could surf without getting rusty!

I don’t really understand why the humans like surfing. It’s kind of just like parking.

At first I was kind of scared of this wave. I saw it and thought _Oh no why is the ocean on the street! It will make me rust!_ But then we went closer and it turns out that this is just a fake wave. It’s made of metal not of ocean water. Humans are so nice to think of making a wave so I could surf without getting rusty.
