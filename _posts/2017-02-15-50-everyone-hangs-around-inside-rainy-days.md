We keep driving through the hills in the middle of California. And it hasn't stopped raining. I would really like it to stop raining, because it just keeps getting in my interior and makes Emma and Sven sad.

They are sad because they keep wanting to go outside, but they think it is too cold and wet. I am always outside, so I don't mind the cold and wet. But I wish it was sunny too guys. I'm sure the sun will come back soon!

Whenever it is wet outside they stay inside and do things (actually they do things outside a lot too, but sometimes they just stay inside). Sometimes they read their books, which are stories like on the blog here. And sometimes they work on the blog, or help me work on my diary so I can tell you all about days like today!
