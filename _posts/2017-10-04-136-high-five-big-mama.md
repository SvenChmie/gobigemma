_Big Mama, you have so many handprints on yourself!_ I told Big Mama while we were camping together. She said that was because all of the humans they had met along the way gave her high fives.

I told her that I had done high fives before and that [I was allowed to give a high five with my face because I didn’t have hands](https://www.instagram.com/p/BX8i4HNg6sI/?taken-by=gobigemma). _But it’s not the same,_ I told her. I wish I had hands and knew what that was like.

Then she said that we could give each other high fives, even if we didn’t have hands! And we didn’t even have to use our faces! So we opened our doors and told our humans that we wanted to drive backwards at each other, but they didn’t want to drive us like that.
