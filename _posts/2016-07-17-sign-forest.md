[The Sign Forest](http://www.gobigemma.com/2016/09/25/adventure-2-day-life-alaska-highway/) is the most popular sight in Watson Lake, Yukon. This tiny town offers every traveler along the Alaska Highway a place to leave their sign. We didn't bring a sign, but we left a _GoBigEmma_ sticker. After searching for the very best place to put it, we finally found the sign that said "Braunschweig", our German hometown. I bet a lot of towns are wondering where their signs have gone...
