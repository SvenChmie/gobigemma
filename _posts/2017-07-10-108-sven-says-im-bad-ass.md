So this is my new nose ring! At first I didn’t like it because I thought it would make me look really silly in pictures and nobody would think I was pretty anymore but it turns out it doesn’t! Sven said it makes me look like a bad ass (which is a good thing), so now I like it!

I asked what bad ass meant and he said it makes me look tough. And I said _Of course I’m tough, can go over any mountains I want__!_ So it’s just perfect because now everyone can see how bad ass I am!

He also said that that will make nobody want to steal my spare tire like they did with my pennies and my toolbox. They will just look at me and say _Oh that__’__s one tough Bus we will never be able to steal anything from her!_ And then they will go away and leave me alone.
