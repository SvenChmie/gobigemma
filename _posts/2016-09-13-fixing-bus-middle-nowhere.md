Fixing the Bus has become a theme of our daily lives. Whenever we think Big Emma is doing fine, the unexpected happens. The Dalton Highway was no exception - our odyssey into the middle of nowhere was cut short by a CV joint that needed changing (and a emergency brake cable that needed adjusting, and a stray e-brake lever bolt that needed reattaching, and a wheel that decided to escape). Even hundreds of miles from the next town, we did not let the repairs defeat us, and got back to safety without the help of a tow-truck.
