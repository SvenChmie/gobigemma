I just look so pretty, don't you think? But this time I'm in the _desert_. I think I've decided that the desert is beautiful, because it makes me look beautiful. Emma said desert colors go well with my red and yellow.

And I like the deserts because there are so many long straight roads. I mean, don't get me wrong, I like curves and windy roads too. But these just do something to your headlights that make you want to look all the way over to the end of the road, but you can't because your headlights don't reach that far! I should ask Sven to give me an upgrade.

I wish [Buddy](http://www.gobigemma.com/2017/01/11/35-thats-buddy/) could see me like this. I bet he'd like it. And I bet the desert goes well with his sparkly orange too.
