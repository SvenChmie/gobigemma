Emma and Sven told me the other day that they were looking at this stuff called clover. It’s a plant, a really tiny one, that grows all over the ground.

Anyways, they said it usually has three leaves. But sometimes it has four leaves instead, but those are really hard to find. And if you find one, you get really lucky or something.

I told them that was stupid. They don’t need some silly plant. They are _really_ lucky! They get to travel all over the place with _me_! Silly humans.
