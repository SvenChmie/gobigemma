I am so excited because Caro and Konsti are going to come visit me! I am especially excited this time because they came to visit me in Alaska, too, but I didn’t write my diaries then so I couldn’t tell you about them! But now I can because now I am really good at writing my diaries!

We had so many adventures up in Alaska, like how we went to visit this [glacier](/gobigemma/2016/08/25/the-mighty-and-the-small). Glaciers are big pieces of ice that buses can’t drive on, but sometimes humans like to walk on them. And we also went to see lots of waterfalls and had a campfire and did a lot of driving! We always have the best adventures when Caro and Konsti are here!

And I am even more excited because that means we will have so many good adventures again!
