These are my favorite palm trees! Look how pretty I am under them!

We have seen so many kinds of trees on our adventures. We saw big [red trees in](/gobigemma/2016/12/07/21-no-favorite-forest) California, and a lot of pines trees in [Alaska](/gobigemma/2016/08/18/alaska-the-land-of-dreams) (where they just went on forever and forever). And I got to know a lot about cactuses (like that [you shouldn't hug them](/gobigemma/2017/04/03/66-cactus-hugs), even if they look like they want a hug). There were some palm trees in California too, but now they are starting to be everywhere!

I got to park at this nice mango farm for a few days. It was lovely! I got to know all about mangoes (they are yellow in Mexico, like me!) and rest my wheels for a few days. Sven and Emma slept in a house, but I wasn't even lonely, because it was so nice here!
