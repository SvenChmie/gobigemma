That's me, over there! I am kind of small, but I am full of the most beautiful sunshine on top of that mountain.

We could see the ocean too, but I preferred to show you the mountains because that's always better than the ocean. This campsite was amazing! We went up this little windy road in the middle of a place called Big Sur (like Big Emma, just Big Sur instead) and it went all up a mountain until we could pull off the road and have this big view all to ourselves.

And the best part was the sunshine! They were right, California is sunnier, at last! I can feel it just everywhere, in my engine and on my wheels and through my open pop top! It is wonderful!
