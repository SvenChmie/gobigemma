So Emma told me about a game called “Where is Waldo” and it’s about a person named Waldo who gets lost all of the time so other people have to find him in pictures and it is really difficult.

I don’t understand why that is a game or why humans think it is fun to find Waldo ([maybe it's like how they always find Momo even though he's not missing](http://gobigemma.de/2017/04/12/70-youre-supposed-find-momo-found-already/)) but I thought _If they like looking for Waldo they will love looking for me!_

So I had Emma and Sven take this picture from really high above everything. I bet you’ll never find me!
