Welcome back to _GoBigEmma_!

A lot has happened since the last time you’ve heard from us. The weeks following the [flood](http://gobigemma.de/2017/10/16/havent-blogging-lately/) were full of complicated shipping arrangements and feelings about going home. Now, we have had a few weeks to get settled in and get our thoughts together.

Starting this week, we will be resuming our normal publishing schedule. We still have plenty of stories to tell you! We will continue where we left off - we have a few more stories about Mexico to share - and of course -everything from Belize, including a more detailed look at being caught in a flash flood and dealing with the aftermath. Big Emma has a lot to say about those adventures in her diary, too.

So check back in with us on Thursdays for new [blog posts](http://gobigemma.de/blog/), as well as every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for new [Big Emma Diaries](http://gobigemma.de/category/big-emma-diaries/). See you there!
