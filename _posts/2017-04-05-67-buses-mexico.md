Look! We finally found another bus! There are other buses in Mexico, not just [bugs like I was afraid of](http://www.gobigemma.com/2017/01/18/38-baja-bug/).

We've been driving through the dusty desert and it was really really dusty, with a lot of cactuses everywhere. And after a really long time with no gas (I was like _What?! There's no gas!? Stupid humans, build a gas station. Cars need gas!_) we got to this dusty town and Emma wanted a taco and saw our first bus in Mexico (besides me, duh)!

This bus is called Mellow. He said we should follow him to camp somewhere because he has a lot of friends in Mexico. I told Emma and Sven that we were going to follow him because I want lots of friends in Mexico, too! See, I told you Mexico wasn't so bad!
