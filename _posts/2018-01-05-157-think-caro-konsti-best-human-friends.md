I was feeling really bad. Not just because my engine doesn’t run and all of me is still too wet. Those don’t feel good either but I was actually feeling bad because I think that [Caro and Konsti](http://gobigemma.de/2017/12/15/151-caro-konsti-coming-visit/) will never want to visit me again because usually we go to fun places and drive all the time but now I can’t do that anymore and instead they just have to clean me all day long.

So I told Caro and Konsti, _Thank you for cleaning me so much. I can’t clean me because I don’t have any hands. But we were supposed to go adventuring together except that I got caught in the [angry river](http://gobigemma.de/2017/12/21/the-consequences-of-a-flash-flood-part-1-blindsided/) and now we can’t go on any adventures and I’m really sorry_.

_That’s okay, Big Emma_, said Konsti, _it’s not your fault you got stuck in a river_. And then Caro said, _And besides, we know you’re not usually like this._ 

_Yeah I don’t usually get stuck in rivers_, I told them. _If you ever want to come visit me again, I promise that I won’t get stuck in another river._

_Don’t worry, we’ll come visit you again_, said Caro. _We still love you. Let’s just park a little more carefully next time._
