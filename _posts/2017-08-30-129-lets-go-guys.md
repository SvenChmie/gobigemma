My [new alternator](http://gobigemma.de/2017/08/10/alternative-alternator-solutions-sourcing-parts-in-mexico/) is buzzing like it’s supposed to and makes me just really want to drive! It’s like I could go anywhere! _Guy’s let’s go to Argentina now!_ I told Emma and Sven.

_Well, I don’t think we will get to Argentina today,_ Sven said. _But we will continue driving! We have a lot of people to see!_ 

_Who are we going to see?_ I asked him. _Just wait_, Sven said, _You’ll see them in no time!_ I was disappointed that he didn’t want to tell me, but it’s also exciting. I was also excited to leave, but I was also disappointed that we will leave the [4Runner](http://gobigemma.de/2017/08/11/122-parking-isnt-always-bad/) behind. I got very used to parking next to him, even if he doesn’t say much. He’s a good parking buddy to have around. I wish we could keep parking together.
