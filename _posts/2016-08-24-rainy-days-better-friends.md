Even rain days can be fun when you meet the right people - or busses. We had the pleasure to run into [Pickle](https://www.instagram.com/vwpickle/), a green bus and their inhabitants, [Ramblin Dawgs](https://www.facebook.com/ramblindawgs). Two wonderful humans and two adventurous dogs made us forget the rain and simply appreciate the beauty of life on the road.
