So we were driving through Belize and you know what? It is so small that Emma said I could drive through all of it in just a few hours! She said we drove on almost all of the highways of the country already and we just got here!

So just in case Belize was listening, I told it _Where I come from it takes days and days to drive through the whole country! And that if you go to Alaska it will take you weeks and weeks!_ And I also said, _And then we went to Mexico and it took us [six months](http://gobigemma.de/2017/11/30/you-have-to-see-it-for-yourself-six-months-of-experience-on-safety-in-mexico/) to drive through all of it! You should try it sometime, maybe you would want to become a bigger country, too!_

But then Emma said it was silly of me to talk to Belize. _Belize is a country, it can’t hear you or talk back or understand anything you’re saying_. _You can’t just talk to random things and expect them to talk back_. And I told Emma, _I don’t understand what you mean, Emma._
