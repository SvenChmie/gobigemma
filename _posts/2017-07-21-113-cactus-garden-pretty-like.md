Now that [we know that I’m not going to go to the Amazon alone](http://gobigemma.de/2017/07/17/111-emma-isnt-angry-anymore/) we can keep adventuring. Sven said I should always look at the bright side of things. I asked if he meant the sun and he said _No, you should look at the positive things in life instead of the negative things_.

So I decided that even though I can’t go to the Amazon right now and even though I have to go to the ocean again the happy thing today is that we went to this place. It is a _cactus garden_. We have seen a lot of cactuses in Mexico. But Emma said this is the place in Mexico where there are the most cactuses really close together. But you still shouldn’t [hug them](http://gobigemma.de/2017/04/03/66-cactus-hugs/).

And not only am I happy because I like the cactus garden, I am also happy because I’m here to make all the pictures even prettier!
