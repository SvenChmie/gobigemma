Wow, what an exhilarating feeling, [we actually made it to Alaska](/gobigemma/2016/08/18/alaska-the-land-of-dreams). After so much planning, preparation, dreaming, and driving, we have made it to our first destination. We drove over the boarder with the widest smiles on our faces. And Big Emma was the happiest of all, humming along without a care in the world, happy to finally see the fabled land of Alaska that she worked so hard to get to.
