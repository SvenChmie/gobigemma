I finally get to write my diary again! Emma said I had to take a break because we went to a new country called Belize. I said _But I don't want to take a break from my diary, what will everybody think of me?_ But Emma said she didn't know if we had enough Internets in Belize to write my diary, but said it was okay to keep talking about Mexico when I could blog again and that's now! So this is what happened back in Mexico:

I did get a surprise, just like Emma and Sven said! We got to see Big Mama from [HV Adventure](https://www.instagram.com/hv_adventure/) again and I was so happy to see her after so long! _Hello Big Mama, it’s great to see you again!_ I told Big Mama when I saw her and got really excited! _I haven’t seen you since California, and that was like forever ago!_

I asked her where she had been since then and she said she had gone all the way to Costa Rica and back! _Wow that’s so far!_ I told her. _What was it like?_

She said it was really rainy, because it’s in the [rainforest](http://gobigemma.de/2017/07/14/110-emma-angry/). I guess Costa Rica is kind of like [Oregon](http://gobigemma.de/2016/11/16/12-all-it-does-here-is-rain/).
