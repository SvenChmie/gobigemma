_Oh my god guys that bus is on fire!_ And then I stepped on the gas pedal and was ready to zoom through the city.

But then Sven stepped on the brake and said, _Big Emma you can’t just drive wildly through the city! There are too many people there!_  And I said, _But I don’t want to be on fire like that bus over there!_

But then Emma explained that it was just a painting, like [the wave that didn’t hit Sven](http://gobigemma.de/2017/05/31/91-watch-sven-actually-just-kidding/). And she even touched it and I was very scared she would be on fire but then she was right. _Why do people paint buses on fire? I asked her, That’s just horrible!_ Emma told me it was something called _art_. I think I don’t like art.
