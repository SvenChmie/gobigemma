Although the road was challenging for Big Emma, it offered world-class views of miles that stretch on and on, out of sight of any other human being and as far as the eye can see. It makes the sunsets spectacular. Even when we were frustrated with our car, we could not help but admire the beauty of this magnificent, open road.
