So we got off the ferry and drove to the Olympic place (‘Olympic National Park’ they keep telling me, why should I care what some place is called by humans?). And all it does here is rain! Like really, really hard, all the time! I’m so wet if I had fur I would look ridiculously silly!

And Sven is just _standing_ outside. I don’t really mind being outside all the time, I am a Bus, after all. But I know Sven and Emma don’t like the pouring rain, so why is he just _standing_ there? He would be much more comfortable inside, where it is not RAINING ALL THE TIME!

He said he wanted to just walk around and look at the woods a bit, because they were so beautiful. Well, right now, I can’t see much of this supposed ‘beauty’ because of the thick curtain of water between those woods and my newly polished headlights…
