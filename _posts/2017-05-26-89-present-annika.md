Look, I have a present for [Annika](http://gobigemma.de/2017/04/28/77-new-friend-annika-like-old-friend/). Emma said that even if she was far away, I could still give her a present, because friends do that.

This is a _hummbird_. It is called that because it goes "hmmmmm" while it flies. I have added it to my [list](http://gobigemma.de/2016/12/14/24-will-add-list/).

Annika really wanted to take a picture of a hummbird while she was here (they don't have them across the ocean where she is from), but they are really fast, so she didn't get to take a picture because it flew away. But I took one for her, so now she can have a picture of a hummbird even if she's not here!
