I made it back to my very own garage in Illinois. It was actually very nice to [turn my engine off](/gobigemma/2018/01/08/158-sven-got-engine-running) and just be in the garage. If I have to just be somewhere, this is my favorite garage to be in. 

I told Emma that I thought that, and asked her what that feeling was called. She said it’s called _Home_.

 

I am going to end my diary here for now and just rest for a while. I like writing it, but I want to write about my adventures and not about the garage. But don’t worry, I’ll let you know before we start going again to Argentina. And I’m glad you liked reading my diary.
