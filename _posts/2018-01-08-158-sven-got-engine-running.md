I’m just so excited because SVEN GOT MY ENGINE RUNNING! Ha! Take that, you stupid [river](http://gobigemma.de/2017/12/20/153-ill-get-back/)! You can’t destroy my engine!

I got so excited about it I said I wanted to drive all around but Sven said that wasn’t so good for me yet and that they still had to clean like all of me anyways so we would stay here for now. 

And he is right. My engine was running but it didn’t feel good like usually. Everything still hurts a little bit. 

But that’s okay, as long as my engine is running!
