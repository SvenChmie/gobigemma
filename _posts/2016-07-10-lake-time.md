On [Lake Time](http://www.gobigemma.com/2016/08/13/adventure-1-road-rockies/), we just ignore the clock and enjoy the scenery, as we were taught to do by a wonderful group of friends on Flathead Lake near Missoula, Montana. Besides spending the 4th of July there and catching an awesome free fireworks show, we also took our first chilly lake bath, took out the canoe, and played some mad card games. The island in the background features herds of wild horses, but they were sadly too small to capture with our camera lens.
