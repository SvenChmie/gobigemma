What do you do in [Wisconsin](http://www.gobigemma.com/2016/08/13/adventure-1-road-rockies/)? Well, you go eat some really _really_ good cheese. At a dairy farm in Thorp, Wisconsin, we saw many different stages of the cheese-making process, from milking to storage. And the best part? Eating it (duh). We left Wisconsin with a refrigerator stocked with garlic & onion, cumin, and foenegreek gouda. Thanks to amazing aunts!
