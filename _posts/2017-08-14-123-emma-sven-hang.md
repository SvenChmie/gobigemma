I told Emma and Sven that if we were going to park again and not adventure that I didn’t want to park in a city, _and_ that they had to [spend more time with me than they did in Guadalahara](/gobigemma/2017/06/09/95-see-guadalahara-made-break). I told them _[We have to stick together](/gobigemma/2017/07/19/112-important-stick-together-not-literally), which means you can’t just always stay in the house!_ And they promised me that they would.

And they have! They spend a lot of time fixing me (which is even better than camping!). They fixed one of my seats, and they wanted to get me a new alternator, and Sven fixed my bright lights, and he greased my front!

Emma even came outside to read in my doorway. I told her _But why are you reading in the doorway? Isn’t it better to sit on the seat?_
