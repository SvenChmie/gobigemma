Look, this was my first adventure in Belize!

So normally humans build bridges and I have had a lot of practice going over bridges. Bridges usually go over water so I don’t have to swim and they are really useful for going over parts of the ocean so I don’t rust and end up [dead like all of the dinosaurs](/gobigemma/2017/10/11/139-oh-no-dinosaurs-dead)! That would just be horrible!

But in Belize they don’t like bridges. So instead they built this ferry, but its also not like all the other ferries I know because it doesn’t use a motor. The humans move it with their hands, they turn this big wheel over and over! So Emma said that I could just sit here and rest while she moved us across the river! I said _That’s so nice Emma I always have to move us. Now you know what it feels like to be a Bus!_
