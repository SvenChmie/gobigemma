So I know I said last time that I was happy I didn’t have to park on the beach and that Emma and Sven would sometimes leave me behind because I didn’t want to go to the beach. But now I am both happy and sad about it.

They really like going to the beach to watch the sunset. When we are camping we always watch the sunset together. It’s one of my favorite times of the day because the sunset is red and yellow like I am and orange like [Buddy](http://gobigemma.de/2017/01/11/35-thats-buddy/).

So now I have to watch the sunset alone because they went to the beach and I wanted to stay behind. Sven said that’s because I should be careful what I wish for.
