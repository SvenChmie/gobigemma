I am finally done [teleporting](http://gobigemma.de/2018/01/12/160-going-teleport-back-illinois/)! And I was so happy to be out of the container and back with Emma that I just had to give her a really big hug.

_You know, Emma_, I said to her, _I’m just happy to see you again. That’s the most important, that it makes me not even worry about not going to Argentina now and everything else._

_You’re right, Big Emma_, she said. _That’s the most important thing._ 

And I was so happy and then I remembered to say _Hello [Andrew](http://gobigemma.de/2017/08/09/121-friend-andrew/)! Thank you for picking me up from the teleporter, too!_
