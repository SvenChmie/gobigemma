Look! I'm a human with legs!

Haha, no I'm just kidding. Of course I don't have legs, that would be ridiculous! I'm a bus, I have _wheels_.

I wonder what it would be like to have legs instead of wheels, though. I guess I wouldn't roll or drive anymore like I do now. I guess I would walk, like Emma and Sven do. But then I would move so slow, how would I ever get to Argentina? I'm glad I have wheels, it is much better to be a bus than a slow human.
