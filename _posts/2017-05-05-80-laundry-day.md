Okay guys, I said I would help with the laundry (I don't want you to think I'm lazy and just sit around all day on the beach!), but that's NOT what I meant!!!

I said I could hold the wash basin or the soap, or maybe hang a towel or two on my windows, but you COVERED me in laundry!!!

Now nobody can see how pretty I am! They will just walk by and think _Oh what a nice laundry stand!_
