I do get to keep parking with the [4Runner](http://gobigemma.de/2017/08/30/129-lets-go-guys/)! We were driving to this beach here and when we were arriving we saw that he had just got here too! I didn’t have to leave him behind after all!

I asked if we could just keep parking together until Argentina. And Sven said, _Well no, sometimes we will park alone, or with other cars. But they might get to Argentina at the same time we will, so I think we will see the 4Runner many times until then_.

That made me pretty happy. I thought about that for a few minutes, and asked Sven, _So that means I don’t have to say_ goodbye, _[like I didn’t do with Buddy](http://gobigemma.de/2017/03/27/63-didnt-say-goodbye/)_? And Sven said, _No, for now, you don’t have to say goodbye_. I told him _That’s good_.
