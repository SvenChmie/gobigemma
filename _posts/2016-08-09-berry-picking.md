Berry picking along the trails is one of our favorite activities! Blueberries, crow berries, salmon berries, raspberries...A wonderful adventure as we learn which ones you can eat, and which ones you should leave alone (don't eat the white ones!). A great part of life in Big Emma as we harvest things we could never buy in the supermarket.
