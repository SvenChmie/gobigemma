We finally left Guadalahara behind!!! Aren’t you happy?

Well that was a stupid question. Of course you’re happy! Who couldn’t be happy to finally be back on the road and be driving and in the sunshine and not be parked alone in Guadalahara all the time! I bet we will have so many new adventures now!

Now we’re going to keep exploring Mexico! I love exploring! Sven and Emma said we are going to go all the way back down to the coast by the Pacific Ocean because Emma’s parents will meet us there. I _haven’t seen them in so long, I can’t wait to see them again!_ I told Sven. _But I’m not going to go by the ocean_.
