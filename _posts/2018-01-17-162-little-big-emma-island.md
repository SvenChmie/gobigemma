Emma and Sven had to wait for me to teleport, so they went to an _island_ in Belize while they waited and then they would take an aeroplane to pick me up from the [teleporter](http://gobigemma.de/2018/01/12/160-going-teleport-back-illinois/) in the USA. I asked _What is an island?_ And Emma said, _An island is a piece of land that is surrounded by the ocean_. And then I told her, _That sounds horrible, Emma! Why would you want to go there? You need to be really careful._

_We will, Big Emma. Remember, [humans don’t rust](http://gobigemma.de/2017/08/18/125-fun-fact/) like cars do. We will be fine on the island. I am just sad you can’t come with us. We will take [Little Big Emma](http://gobigemma.de/2017/11/20/140-little-big-emma/) for you instead_. But I didn’t tell Emma that I think it is stupid that Little Big Emma gets to go even if it is an island and I don’t want to go anyways because then Little Big Emma gets to take pictures like this one instead of me. 

But it’s also kind of okay that now I am just teleporting and not doing anything. I’m still kind of tired. 

I feel stupid because I can’t drive right and Sven and Emma can’t live in me and camp with me now. What kind of Bus am I if I can’t camp with them? That’s all I did in the last few years and we went all the way to Alaska and to Canada and all over Mexico and we met [Buddy](http://gobigemma.de/2017/01/11/35-thats-buddy/) and [Rita](http://gobigemma.de/2017/01/16/37-surfing-stupid-found-rita/) and the [4Runner](http://gobigemma.de/2017/08/11/122-parking-isnt-always-bad/). Now all I can do is sit in the garage. What if that makes me [dead like the dinosaurs](http://gobigemma.de/2017/10/11/139-oh-no-dinosaurs-dead/)?

I hope that I am not dead like the dinosaurs. I still want to go to Argentina and have all the adventures on the way. 

I hope I am done [teleporting](http://gobigemma.de/2018/01/12/160-going-teleport-back-illinois/) soon.
