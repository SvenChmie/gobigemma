I like Belize because we are in the jungle a lot, and I’ve been excited to go to the jungle since almost forever because it’s not the ocean and there is nothing stupid here like rust or [surfing](http://gobigemma.de/2017/01/16/37-surfing-stupid-found-rita/).

And so I was camping here in the jungle enjoying how far away we are from the ocean and then I thought I saw a baby [dinosaur](http://gobigemma.de/2017/10/11/139-oh-no-dinosaurs-dead/)! It looked exactly like Emma said it should look except that it was very small, not even as long as I am. And so I asked it nicely, _Hello dinosaur, are you [dead like a zombie](http://gobigemma.de/2017/08/23/127-emma-says-look-like-zombie/)?_

And then Sven said _That’s not a dinosaur, it’s a crocodile, Big Emma! And if you get too close it will eat you!_ I was really worried about getting eaten and then he told me that he was just kidding and that crocodiles don’t eat Buses. _But what if you’re wrong and they do eat me?_ I asked him.

Now I’m not so sure if the jungle is better than the ocean if I could get eaten by a crocodile. So I told the crocodile, _If you try to eat me I’ll run you over._
