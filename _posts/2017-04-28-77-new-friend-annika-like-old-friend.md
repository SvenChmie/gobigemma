We have a new friend traveling with us! Her name is Annika!

But actually it's kind of like she is an old friend, not a new friend at all. I mean, I've never actually _met_ Annika before, but I've heard all about her because she is important to Sven and Emma and they have pictures of her hanging in my interior and stuff. So it's kind of like I knew her before, too.

And it made me really happy to see her for the first time! I told her _Hello Annika!!!_ and said that I was really happy to have her traveling with us. I tried to give her a hug too, but then I remembered I don't have any arms, so she gave me one instead.
