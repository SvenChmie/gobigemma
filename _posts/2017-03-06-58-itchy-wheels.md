Sven said we could go get a new battery today. He said he didn't want me to feel embarrassed if I couldn't start again.

I told him _Good, I want to be able to start, because I would really like to go camping now that I have my engine back in_. I really like it here with Buddy, and I like getting a lot of new things and how much everybody cares about me. But we are also in the middle of a big city. I've been here for over three weeks! It's been so long since we went camping like we usually do. I don't know why, but I just have the urge to _move_.

Sven said he understood what I meant. He says humans have words for that feeling when you want to go somewhere else after you've been in one place for a long time. He said they call it _itchy wheels_. I asked him what _itchy_ means, and he said it was like when you get this funny uncomfortable feeling in your wheels. My brakes have been squeaking recently, and have been feeling funny, so I guess there are _itchy_.
