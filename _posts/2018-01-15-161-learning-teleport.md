Look, now I’m teleporting! This is me getting [into the container before I started teleporting](http://gobigemma.de/2018/01/12/160-going-teleport-back-illinois/). 

But now I’m all alone except with [Eduardo](http://gobigemma.de/2017/09/07/snapshots-it-sounds-like-an-adventure/), and it’s very dark here in the teleporter. It reminds me of being [in the river](http://gobigemma.de/2017/12/21/the-consequences-of-a-flash-flood-part-1-blindsided/). I don’t think I like teleporting that much.

And it feels like being on a boat, and I don’t like being on boats because they go over the ocean and then I could fall off and rust or it could get angry like the river and then I would rust too. I’m glad I’m just in the teleporter and not on a boat. 

I have a long time to think and talk to myself and to Eduardo. And even if I don’t like the container and the river and that my engine doesn’t run well and that I can’t go to Argentina until my interior is better and that I have to go to Illinois first which is even farther away from Argentina than Belize then I can still be happy about being in Illinois soon and seeing Emma’s family and my own garage and getting a new interior and learning how to teleport. It’s okay if it takes us longer to get to Argentina, it just makes the adventure longer. 

I wonder how long teleporting takes.
