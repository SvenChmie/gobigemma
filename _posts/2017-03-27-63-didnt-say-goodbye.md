I didn’t say goodbye to Buddy. I’m really sad.

We went back to Oceanside one last time so I could say goodbye, but Buddy didn’t come. Robbie pulled out Buddy's steering column to do something to it, so he couldn’t drive to say goodbye.

Robbie gave me a hug from Buddy, but it’s not the same. Now we’re in Mexico, but I don’t really care. I just wish I could have said goodbye.
