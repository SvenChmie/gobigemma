These things are everywhere! They are called cactus. There were a lot of them back up in California too, but here they are _everywhere_! Except when you’re parked right next to the ocean.

And they look so grumpy. They grow in all sorts of weird shape and some of them get really really tall, almost as tall as [Mount Rainier](/gobigemma/2016/11/02/6-mount-rainier-even-bigger)! I decided I would hug one, so it wouldn’t be so grumpy. Maybe then it will get better. But then Emma said I shouldn’t hug the cactus.

_But I want to give it a hug!_ I told Emma. _It looks so mean! I think it just needs a little bit of love!_
