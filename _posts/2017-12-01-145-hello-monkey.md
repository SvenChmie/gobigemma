Look, I met a _monkey_!

Emma said that a lot of monkeys live in Belize and that we could go get to see them and then we got to go see them! I didn’t know anything about monkeys before. Emma had told me that they are kind of like humans and kind of like dogs except that they use their tails like hands and live in trees. And I thought _What a strange animal!_ I have to meet one now and [put it on my list](http://gobigemma.de/2016/12/14/24-will-add-list/)!

Emma said we would see a lot more monkeys on our way to Argentina. But not in Argentina, because they don’t live there.
