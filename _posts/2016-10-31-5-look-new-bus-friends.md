I _did_ make friends (I mean, who cares about a stupid leaky window? Of _course_ they like me!)!! A lot of them! There’s _Irie_ from [Irie To Aurora](https://www.instagram.com/irietoaurora/) over there in the corner, and _Rita_ from [The Bus And Us](https://www.instagram.com/thebusandus/) over on the other side, and _Lolo_ from [Ryan And Hailey](https://www.instagram.com/ryan.and.hailey/) in front of me. They are soo cool, they all just kept hanging out with me! _Descend on Bend_ was only a weekend and we just kept hanging out afterwards! I think I made some _real_ bus friends.

We’ve had so many amazing adventures the last few days - we went camping in the woods, and then we met up with other buses and made a big campfire. And Sven took my silly leaky-window-bag off (whew!), because it wasn't raining so much. And - the best part - I asked my new bus friends if they had ever had leaky windows, and they have too! They didn’t think I was weird at all. We all have so much in common, it’s crazy!

Man, good weather and good friends! That just makes me want to go “MEEEEP!” (the good kind, of course).
