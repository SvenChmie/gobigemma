So I finally got the [cows](http://www.gobigemma.com/2017/04/07/68-go-away-stupid-cows/) to move and we made it to where [Mellow](http://www.gobigemma.com/2017/04/05/67-buses-mexico/) was. He has so many friends. And the best part was that he said he would share them with me! Now I have so many new friends, too! These are my favorite friends in Baja!

Over there is [Mali.mish](https://www.instagram.com/mali.mish/), and there is our new friends called [Wanderwasi](https://www.instagram.com/wanderwasi/) (I don’t know why they are called that, I told Emma I think the name is strange). And my old friend [Red Beard](https://www.instagram.com/bodes.well/)! I’m really excited to see him again! But I’ll tell you about that later. We have all been parking here and having a great time in the sunshine. We might never leave!

Mellow is here, too, of course! But he is parked over there by the ocean, and I told him _I’m not parking so close to the ocean! What are you doing? It will make you rust!_ But he said he didn’t care, the view was just too good from there. I told him I don’t care, I’m parking over here behind Red Beard, where I won’t rust away.

I wish [Buddy](http://www.gobigemma.com/2017/02/22/53-buddy-likes-gave-hearts/) could meet all my new friends. I’m sure he would park with me back here, so he wouldn’t rust, too.
