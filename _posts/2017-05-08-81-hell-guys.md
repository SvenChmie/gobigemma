WHAT THE HELL, GUYS?!? You seriously just LEFT me like that?

So yesterday Emma and Sven and Annika went to park at this beach and they keep talking about how other cars here in Mexico keep getting stuck in the sand and they have to be rescued before they can drive again. And I thought _Don't worry, I'll never get stuck!_ But then we went to this beach and Sven drove me into the sand! And because it was night time they decided to _leave_ me stuck all night long! You guys stink.

They did get me back out in the morning though. I was so ashamed! At least if they had gotten me unstuck at night no other cars would see me in this ridiculous position. They even _slept_ in my like that, all angled to the back. This is NOT funny, guys.
