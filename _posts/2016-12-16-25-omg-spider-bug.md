That is a HUGE spider-bug! Spider-bugs have been on the list of animals that I have met for a long time, but they were always really small. This one is HUGE!

Not a lot scares a big strong Bus like me, but that made me a little nervous. It was just so BIG.

But Sven said it was okay, it wasn’t like regular animals and he said it wouldn’t move. I was scared it would, but we parked next to it so Sven could take some pictures and it didn’t so I thought it would be okay. I think I don’t like spider-bugs as much as I used to.
