See, I’m just parked out here alone all day every day and being bored and I can’t go exercise my wheels at all!! No wonder my engine is having problems!! It wouldn’t accelerate right and I knew something bad like this would happen in this stupid city!

So Sven had to come out to fix me. At least now I have some company. See, I had to go break so that Emma and Sven would even come out of their stupid _hostel_ and visit me!

At least Sven fixed me fine, so now I run again like normal. But that just means I’ll be stuck on this empty white street all alone again until Sven and Emma decide to come visit me. What if they decide not to come back? Guadalahara sucks.
