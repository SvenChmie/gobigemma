So here’s another picture of beautiful Guanahato, because I just look so beautiful here!

There is _one_ thing that I don’t like so much about Guanahato. It kind of has a lot of hills. Now, I am good at hills, I’m really really strong and like to show everybody how well I can go up them, even if I have to go slow. But there were some hills I just didn’t want to go up in Guanahato, because I thought they were stupid.

See, to get to our really nice campspot, we had to go up this really big hill. I told Sven that I didn’t really want to but he insisted we go up it anyways. So half way up when it got really steep I told him _I don’t want to go this way!_ And stopped driving. So Sven had to back me up and went a different way and I told him _again_ that I didn’t really want to but he insisted _again_ so we went up it and then i said I DONT WANT TO GO THIS WAY EITHER! So I made us go a different way (the way only cars from the other direction are supposed to go) and we got there just fine. We should _always_ do it my way, because my way is always the best.
