I really like Annika! She takes such good pictures of me! Like this one, of me on a cliff!

She said this was the best time to take some pictures of me, because it was early in the morning and that is when the light turns to gold. Sven and Emma usually don't wake up very early in the morning because they really like sleeping. But Annika said she had to get up early, because she came from across the ocean like most of the people that visit us.

And I said, _Well why does that make you get up early?_ And Annika told me it was because time worked differently over there, and everybody lived early in the morning. That seems silly to me, because all of the humans _I know_ like to be awake during the daylight. Maybe they just use their headlights more often over there across the ocean.
