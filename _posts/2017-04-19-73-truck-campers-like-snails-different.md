My new friends are so awesome! We parked together for almost forever!

We moved to this campground, and [Mellow](http://www.gobigemma.com/2017/04/05/67-buses-mexico/) couldn’t come with us because his human had to go somewhere else. But that’s okay, [Red Beard](http://www.gobigemma.com/2017/04/14/71-old-friend-red-beard/) and the others are still here, and they are my friends now, too! And this time I parked a little closer to the ocean, because everybody else was in a line and I didn’t want to be stupid and say _Well I don’t want to park in the line because it’s next to the ocean_ because _they_ weren’t scared of parking next to the ocean.

But I was thinking: [Mali.mish](https://www.instagram.com/mali.mish/) and [Wanderwasi](https://www.instagram.com/wanderwasi/) are both _truck campers_. That means they are trucks with a camper attached to their backs. This seems so strange to me, because then the humans have their house on the backs of their cars! It is just like the animals called _snails_ (I know about them because they are on [my list of animals](http://www.gobigemma.com/2016/12/14/24-will-add-list/)), who also carry their houses on their backs all the time. Except that trucks are much faster than _snails_. I think it’s better to be a Bus.
