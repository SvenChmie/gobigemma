Annika had to leave today. I really liked having her camp with us all of the time. We had a lot of good conversations about all kinds of things.

I asked if we could go visit Annika, but Emma said we have to drive to Argentina first. And that buses can't go on _aeroplanes_, I would have to take a boat all the way across the ocean. _That's no problem at all_, I said, _I just really really love the ocean and it wouldn't scare me a bit to be on a boat forever_. But Emma said I didn't have to, because maybe Annika would come back before we got to Argentina.

And then when I was feeling sad this _flying dragon_ landed on my door, and it made me feel a little better, because it was beautiful. And red, like me. I will add _flying dragons_ to my [list](/gobigemma/2016/12/14/24-will-add-list).
