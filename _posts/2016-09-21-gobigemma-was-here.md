As we started to head south, we backtracked along part of the Alaska Highway on our way to the Cassiar Highway, passing back through Watson Lake. We were glad to see that our sticker was still there, on our favorite sign in the [Sign Forrest](http://www.gobigemma.com/2016/09/25/adventure-2-day-life-alaska-highway/).
