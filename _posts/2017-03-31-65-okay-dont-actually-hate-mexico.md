Okay, I shouldn’t have said that I hate Mexico. I don’t _actually_ hate Mexico. I’m sorry Mexico.

It’s just that I miss Buddy, and wish I could have said goodbye. And here I haven’t seen any other buses at all. Just bugs, and we camp all by ourselves.

But still, it is pretty here. And I have Emma and Sven, so I can’t be that lonely. And I’m sure there are a lot of adventures that we can have in Mexico.
