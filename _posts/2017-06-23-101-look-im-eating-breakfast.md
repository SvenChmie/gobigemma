Haha look, I’m a human! I’m going to eat breakfast just like they do!

No, I’m just kidding. I don’t like _breakfast_! I like _gas_! But I love being in the house with Emma and Sven again!

I asked Emma why humans eat breakfast anyways. Emma said it was because humans get hungry in the mornings after they were sleeping in the night. _But that doesn’t make sense_, I told her. _What does breakfast have to do with the morning? Don’t you just eat when you’re empty and need to fill up on food? Why are humans always empty in the mornings, even though they ate food before they slept, too?_
