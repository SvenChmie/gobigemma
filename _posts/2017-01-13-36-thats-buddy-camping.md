So after we did so much cruising around and getting washed, we went to the airport! A friend of Emma and Sven’s came to visit from really far away. I don’t know him very well yet, but if he’s friends with my humans he’s probably a good one, too.

And then we went camping! We just look so cute there in the sunshine. Buddy’s orange color goes perfect with my gorgeous red and yellow!

I asked what we were going to do next and Buddy said something horrible! He said we were going to go park by the ocean because the humans wanted to try this thing called surfing where you stand on a big thing and get pushed around by the waves. I said that sounded ridiculous, they couldn’t possibly want to do that. _Of course_ they won’t want to go into the ocean!
