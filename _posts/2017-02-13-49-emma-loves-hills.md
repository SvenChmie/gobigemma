Look, these are a lot of hills. Emma calls them _rolling hills_, which is weird because they don't move at all. We keep seeing a lot of them because we are going to see a friend of Emma's and they are all in the way.

Emma said she really likes them. She said she thinks they are very pretty, and very peaceful. She said that I felt like that about the stars, but I'm not quite sure that is right. We can drive to the rolling hills and even through them, and Emma said we couldn't go to the stars, so I don't see how they are like the stars at all.

We have been camping and driving for a few days in the rolling hills. And it keeps raining. Emma said that there is a winter storm, and even in places like California it rains when there is a winter storm. I wish [Buddy](/gobigemma/2017/01/11/35-thats-buddy) was here.
