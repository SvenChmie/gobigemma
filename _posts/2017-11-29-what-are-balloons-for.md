See Sven, I didn’t get eaten by a crocodile! Or a [dinosaur](/gobigemma/2017/10/11/139-oh-no-dinosaurs-dead)! But it was a nice place to stay, I got to watch the river flow by all day!

While I was parking Sven and Emma went into town to see a lot of people walking in a really long line called a _parade_. I asked them why so many people wanted to walk in a big line and why they wanted to watch people walking in a line. _Imagine if it was a line of Buses, Big Emma_ said Sven, _Then you would totally want to go watch them drive in a line_. And he’s right, I _would_ like to see Buses walk in a line so now I kind of understand.

They showed me all the pictures and this one was my favorite! I asked what is in the picture and they said this is called _balloons_. I asked what humans use them for and Emma said that humans just carry them around with them for decoration. _Could I do that?_ _I think I like balloons_ I told her_. Yeah_, she said, _And if you get enough of them they will pull you into the sky and you will fly away! They made a movie about that once_. So I spent a long time thinking what I would look like flying through the sky with a bunch of balloons.
