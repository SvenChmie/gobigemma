Sven and Emma said that California was going to be sunny, but they forgot to mention all this traffic! It's horrible.

There are cars everywhere. And not cool VWs, but all kinds of modern cars that zoom right and left and it makes you just go crazy. Driving is supposed to be chill, and slow. Otherwise you can't look at all of the cool stuff around you. But all of these cars just go really fast and don't care at all. How can they be so adventureless?

Except now, I guess, because they are all just standing still forever! Seriously, we have all been standing here for like half of the afternoon. We will never get any adventuring done this way! Move cars! MEEEEEEP.
