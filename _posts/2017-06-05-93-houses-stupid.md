Look, this is another [volcano](/gobigemma/2017/06/02/92-volcanos-supposed-explode)! Except that this one is very different. It has a lake in it, and we had to drive really far down to get to it, instead of really far up, like we did at the other volcano. This volcano is also sleepy, Sven said, so it won’t explode either.

_But why is there a lake in the volcano?_ I wanted to ask Sven. But before I could, something happened: Emma started talking about an idea about staying in a house for a while, instead of camping with me!

And I said _WHAT how can you not want to camp with me but stay in a stupid house instead!?!_ Emma said it was because they felt like they had to move all the time and they wanted to not move for a while, and I just said _Yeah that’s why I’m a Bus and your idea is stupid_. _How would you like it if I went and camped without you?_
