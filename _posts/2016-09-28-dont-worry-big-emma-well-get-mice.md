When I woke up in the middle of the night to Sven saying "Emma, there are mice in our Bus!" I was simply incredulous. Mice, in our Bus?! They were living somewhere underneath, in the frame of the Bus (we think) and coming in to visit us at night. F\*ck. Eating food, chewing on cables, they are culprits of all kinds of mischief. So, what do you do when you wake up to mice running around? Definitely not go back to sleep, and certainly do your best to remove them. Our solution: A pan, a cracker, a bowl, and a straw with a string attached. Sadly, our clever contraption only comes with a manual mode. We caught and removed two mice like this - and are very sad to say that we also removed one the next night with a more conventional mouse trap. The homemade version is the preferred method - but we are glad that we have not had to use it again since.
