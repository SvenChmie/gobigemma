This is one beautiful bridge! It is red, just like me! I have gone over a lot of bridges before, but they are never red. And this one is really really big (again, like me!).

I get a little nervous around bridges usually, at least ones that go over the ocean, like this one. Some bridges are fine, they just go over rivers or lakes or stuff, which isn't the ocean so they're not so bad.

But this one isn't bad either. It's very big and feels pretty safe. And lot of other cars go over it, and all of them seem to think it's fine. So I decided I will just enjoy the beautiful bridge and ignore the water underneath.
