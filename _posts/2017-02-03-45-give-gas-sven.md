So remember how [gas is like _chocolate_](http://www.gobigemma.com/2016/12/26/29-tasting-things-weird/)? I really like having gas, and I’m always really disappointed when I run out in the middle of nowhere. I’m just like _Really guys? Why didn’t you put more gas in?_ Emma said gas was different than chocolate though, because she doesn’t need chocolate to go anywhere like I need gas.

Sven got a bit annoyed at me for saying that I think. I know my gas gauge doesn’t work, it hasn’t worked in a long time. But gas gauges do that sometimes, and it’s not like I can fix it! I don’t have any hands and I can’t just magically fix it.

They always count my miles and write them down in a little book. He told me if I don’t want to run out, maybe I should count the miles next time. Well fine Sven, why don’t I just count so this doesn’t happen again!
