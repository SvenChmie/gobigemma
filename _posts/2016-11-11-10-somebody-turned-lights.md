Okay, so while we were working on my window the other day, I said, “You know, Sven, you really could take a look at my headlights. My vision has been getting kind of foggy lately…”. And Sven said he had thought about that, too. He said they changed the time or something recently, which meant that it keeps getting dark really early and that my lights weren’t making enough light. Not making enough light! Well that’s ridiculous. He probably just hasn’t cleaned them right.

So I insisted he take them apart and give them a good cleaning. He took everything off and then I couldn’t see anything at all. I told them I wouldn’t drive _anywhere_ until they had fixed all of that. So Sven stuck some paper towels down my headlights and rubbed them around and got all of this crud out. When he put them back together, everything was nice and shiney. Not enough light….what nonsense.

They said we would be doing some serious camping coming up, so I’m glad we got that all sorted out.
