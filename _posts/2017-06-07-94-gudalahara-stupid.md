This is Guadalahara. Look, it’s really boring with just this big white wall. White is boring, not like me, because I’m red and yellow.

This is where I have to park while Emma and Sven decided to stay in something like a house (except they call it a _hostel_). I have to stay here all alone all day while they stay inside. They said that they want to work in a _hostel_ here in this boring boring city, and stay here even longer!!! What am I going to do all the time, just parked out here on this crummy street all alone? I can’t keep watch on Emma and Sven and make sure they are okay if they are never here for me to watch them!

It’s boring and I don’t like being alone. The only people who come are strangers that look in my windows and I don’t like them. And there are no trees or lakes or volcanos here at all, it’s all just white boringness. Guadalahara is stupid, just like _hostels_.
