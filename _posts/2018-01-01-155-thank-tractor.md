Sven and Emma came back to get me and they brought Caro and Konsti with them and a lot of other people. 

I didn’t know what to say to them when they got back, so I just told them _[The river](http://gobigemma.de/2017/12/21/the-consequences-of-a-flash-flood-part-1-blindsided/) pushed me on my side and I’m really happy to see you again_. 

_We are too, Big Emma_, said Sven, _but we need to figure out how to move you. Just wait here a bit._

And then they came back with all these people and a car called a _tractor_. The tractor said something to me but it was all in Spanish. I told the tractor, _I’m still learning Spanish, do you know English?_ But I don’t think it did because it didn’t answer me. 

All of the humans attached a rope to my underside and to the tractor. _You got this, Big Emma_, said Emma, _the tractor is really strong and can get you out of here!_ I wanted to help them, but I couldn't move at all like this on my side. I told them _Watch out I don’t want to tip over to the other side!_ But the tractor was careful and I tipped back onto my wheels. It felt really really good to be back on my wheels.

I told them, _I’m sorry I can’t drive myself, my engine doesn’t run right now_. So they towed me all the way out of the river. They were all very nice about me not being able to use my engine.

_I’m tired_, I told Sven. He said, _That’s okay, Big Emma, you did everything you had to. You can rest now._ 

_Okay,_ I told him. _I knew you guys would rescue me._
