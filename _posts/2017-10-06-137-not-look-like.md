Emma and Sven wanted to high five Big Mama too, so I told them to high five her for me because they wouldn’t let us high five with our doors. So Emma said _That’s a great idea, Big Emma!_

So she said they were going to draw a picture of me with their high five. But they made me look horribly ugly!

_I DON’T LOOK LIKE THAT!_ I told them. _I am much prettier and better shaped than you think I am!_ I said I didn’t like their high five.
