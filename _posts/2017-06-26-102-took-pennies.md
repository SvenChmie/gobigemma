So I was so annoyed that all of my tools were gone that I didn’t even see when they took [my pennies](http://gobigemma.de/2017/04/26/76-penny-collection/) and pesos too! It was like I blinked and they were just all gone!

I was really sad. I said, _But what do you need all those pennies for? A lot of them are from Argentina and Canada and a lot of other places that aren’t Mexico!_ I worked so hard collecting all of them, I waited a long time for people to put them in my tire. And nobody has ever taken one before, they only added them. But now all but four are gone.

I hope at least that whoever took them really needed them. I’ll make a new collection, you’ll see.
