All of that annoying traffic was so worth it! This city does have old cars, and I just made two new VW friends! Look, right over there are the PattyWagon and Buddy! They are just beautiful VWs, don't you think?

Sven and Emma said that we were going to meet some very cool friends here, and they were right! They said that one human really likes me (and that he knew me, even though he never met me!). But, then again, who couldn't like me?

They also said that this one human was a really good at fixing VWs! And that he would help to fix anything that may not be perfect in my engine. I told them _What, not perfect in my engine? Everything is perfect about my engine!_
