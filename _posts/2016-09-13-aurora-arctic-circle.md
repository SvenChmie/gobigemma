After deciding to head back in Wiseman, Alaska, we camped the night at the Arctic Circle and watched the Northern Lights dance across the sky. Bending and twisting, they move and shoot green and other colors across the sky. To keep out the cold, Sven and I opened the sliding door, cuddled up in blankets, and watched the sky from our cozy bus bed. As we fell asleep, the lights shined overhead.
