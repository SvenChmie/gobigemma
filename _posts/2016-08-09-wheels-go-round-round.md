Have you ever wondered why wheels can turn as they do? Think about it - at least on Big Emma, they are lower than the engine (the thing that makes it go) and the transmission (the thing that gives you gears), and yet they do not lose the speed they are provided with. It is because of these nifty gadgets: CV (or "Constant Velocity") Joints. Each rear wheel has them, and they transfer the force in a diagonal direction. Ingenious - and very, very greasy - little things!
