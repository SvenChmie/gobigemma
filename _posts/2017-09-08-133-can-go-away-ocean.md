The [4Runner](/gobigemma/2017/08/11/122-parking-isnt-always-bad) left the other day, but that’s okay, because we’ll see each other again!

Now we went to this beach. We keep having to go to beaches and I just want to not be at the beach! I asked Emma _When will we finally be away from stupid beaches?_

But Emma and Sven said that [Rita](/gobigemma/2017/01/16/37-surfing-stupid-found-rita) was at this beach a few years ago, when she was on the way to Argentina. So I guess it can’t be that bad. But I still don't like beaches.
