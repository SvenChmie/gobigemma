We left [my new friends](http://www.gobigemma.com/2017/04/10/69-look-many-new-friends-mexico/), they wanted to go back _north_ and we are going _south_. They were a lot of fun to park with, and it was really good talking to Red Beard and thinking about my old adventures. I’m going to miss them.

So we went to this town called Loreto. I like it. It's really good here, I don’t have to be parked right next to the ocean here all the time.

And it is so colorful! This is my favorite wall in Loreto, because it’s pained so nicely! It is beautiful, like me!  And parking next to it makes me look beautiful! I wish [Buddy](http://www.gobigemma.com/2017/02/22/53-buddy-likes-gave-hearts/) could come see me parked next to it.
