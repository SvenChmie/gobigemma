So, the ocean is really great and everything. Annika and Sven keep sitting over there and watching the people [_surfing_](/gobigemma/2017/01/16/37-surfing-stupid-found-rita).

All of the surfers have _wet suits_ on, so they don't rust in the ocean. But Annika and Sven don't have _wet suits_, so I watched them sit there to make sure they didn't start to rust. If they do start to rust, I'll just spray them with our rust spray and they'll be okay again. But I don't think they will, because the ocean probably hopefully isn't that bad.

But maybe it would be better to come sit with me instead guys? I mean, I don't have anything _against_ the ocean, but over here is more in the sand. Isn't that better?
