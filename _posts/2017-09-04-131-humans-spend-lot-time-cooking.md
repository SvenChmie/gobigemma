_Why do you spend so much time cooking?_ I asked Sven. _Well, because it’s cheaper than eating at restaurants, and I can do it here at home with you_, he told me.

_Yeah, with me is definitely better_, I told him. _But why do you need to spend so much time cooking or eating at restaurants?_ He said, _Because humans need to eat food or we won’t work right._

_I guess it is kind of like [chocolate and gas](http://gobigemma.de/2016/12/26/29-tasting-things-weird/)_, I said. He said it was, but that there are many different kinds of things to eat, and some were better than others. _Like premium gas?_ I asked him. _Yes_, Sven said, _but think about if there were hundreds of types of premium gas_. And I thought wow maybe it would be good to be a human to have so many types of gas. But then I also would never know which one to pick.
