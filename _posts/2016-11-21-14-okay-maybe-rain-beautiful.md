Okay, so maybe rain can be beautiful too. We were driving around this forest (it’s actually not a forest, it is a _rain_forest, where it just always rains) and we stopped to take some pictures and it was actually very beautiful.

Okay, so I am also in the middle of the picture...it does make it a little easier to see the beauty.

But it wasn’t just me, I admit. The trees were very tall, and lots of them were mossy. I don’t want to be mossy, but it makes trees kind of pretty, and gives this rainforest a kind of jungly-feeling. Which I guess is good, because apparently the jungle, like when we get down to Brazil and stuff, is also a rainforest.
