This is Momo, he’s a dog. And a cute one at that (not as cute as me, of course, but he’s also not a Bus, so he can’t be). Dogs are funny. Sven and Emma talk about having a dog travel with us too, one day. Momo isn’t our dog though, he travels with [Mellow](http://www.gobigemma.com/2017/04/05/67-buses-mexico/) and his human, [Andrew](https://www.instagram.com/andrewknapp/).

Anyway, you’re supposed to always [find Momo](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/findmomo/). But I don’t understand, because Momo is already here! I don’t need to find him! Why do all the humans always say I need to find Momo?! I found him, guys, you can stop looking now!

We had a lot of time on the beach, so I talked to Mellow. I asked him if he was scared of rusting, because [he parks so close to the ocean](http://www.gobigemma.com/2017/04/10/69-look-many-new-friends-mexico/). He told me he wasn’t scared, because rust happens very slowly. And, he said, you only get to be a bus once, so you should park in the best spots that you can. But I don’t think next to the ocean is the best spot, if it makes you rust.
