I learned all about _Fun Facts_ the other day! So _Fun Facts_ have to be both fun and a fact. _Fun_ means it has to be interesting and a _fact_ is something that is true. And the good thing is that fun facts can be about anything at all as long as they are fun and facts!

I wanted to share with you a _Fun Fact_: Humans don’t rust in the ocean! Who would have thought!? I was always scared Emma and Sven would come back from the ocean completely rusted!

But they don’t! That’s so fun! It turns out that even if the ocean rusts Buses like me, it doesn’t rust humans because they are made of something different called _skin_. That’s good because I think Emma and Sven really like the ocean and sometimes they even go surfing or swimming in it. But I guess it’s okay to go swimming if you don’t rust.
