Why did we have to go here anyways? What makes Mexico so special? I want to be back in Oceanside with Buddy instead.

It’s really lonely here. I’m all alone, on this cliff, and the ocean is right there. I don’t like the ocean, it will make me rust away. But now that we went to Mexico, we can’t go back until we go all the way to Argentina. So I guess I have to be by the ocean for a long time.

And I look silly. Emma and Sven added this stuff to my roof to make me look like I don’t have solar panels, so nobody will try to take them. But they didn’t even ask me if I like it! I think it looks rediculous. I hate Mexico.
