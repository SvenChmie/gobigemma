I got really excited the other day when we pulled into a parking lot and I thought _Oh my look [Buddy](/gobigemma/2017/03/27/63-didnt-say-goodbye) came to Mexico!_ But then we pulled up next to him and I realized he wasn’t Buddy at all.

I mean, he was nice and everything. But a lot less shiny and nice and from Mexico instead of California. Like, he seemed nice but he just wasn’t Buddy. He just looked like him.

It made me really sad because it made me miss Buddy. We’ve had so many adventures since we came to Mexico and I didn’t get to say goodbye to Buddy but with all of the adventures I didn’t think about him a lot. But now I do so I miss him and was sad. But Emma said we can go take some more pretty pictures of me in Guanahato so I would feel better. But I don’t yet.
