_Sven, my [engine is running](/gobigemma/2018/01/08/158-sven-got-engine-running), but I don’t know if I can make it all the way back to Illinois on my own. It doesn’t feel like it did before I [got stuck in the river](/gobigemma/2017/12/20/153-ill-get-back). What if I have to be towed back to Illinois?_ 

_We don’t want to tow you_, said Sven. _That would also be really expensive_. So I said, _What does expensive mean? Is it like embarrassing?_ But Sven said it wasn’t and it wasn’t important.

_We will need to put you in a container and ship you to the States_, said Sven. I told Sven _I don’t know what that means. Can I go in an [aeroplane](/gobigemma/2017/01/23/40-went-new-human-phil-desert) instead_? But Sven said I couldn’t fly in an aeroplane because they don’t let cars on aeroplanes. 

_Well where is the container, and how does it get me to Illinois?_ I asked. Sven said, _That’s how humans get fast from one place to another without a car. It’s called_ teleporting_. We are almost done cleaning you, so tomorrow we will drive you to the teleporter._ 

_Okay, as long as I don’t have to go on a boat_, I said. _I don’t want to get stuck in the ocean, too_.
