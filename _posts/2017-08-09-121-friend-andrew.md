This is my friend Andrew, he’s Emma’s dad. He loves buses and especially me!

I’m so glad he came to see me. Now he and Sven help fix me together and I get so much attention! Andrew used to fix me all the time before we went traveling and he made all of my insides really nice. He even made my outside nice too and made it shinier than I ever was before. It's because of him that everybody we see thinks I'm so beautiful!

Emma’s parents visited us one time before when we were in Canada, but this is better. They had another car there that they got from the areoport where the aeroplanes come from so they didn’t take me everywhere they went. But now they didn’t get a stupid other car, so we go somewhere every day in me! I wish Emma’s parents didn’t have to leave so quickly.
