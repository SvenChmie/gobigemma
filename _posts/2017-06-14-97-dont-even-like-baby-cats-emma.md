I don’t like houses or stupid Guadalahara or the stupid bug down the street or anything at all.

I told that to Emma so she tried to make me feel better by bringing me this baby cat. I told her I don’t like baby cats either, nothing can make me feel better!

(I do actually like baby cats. I’m glad baby cats can’t read diaries).
