Who is this little cutie? It's [Alaska](https://www.facebook.com/K9AdventureTime/). No, not the state, the dog! She's a Peruvian street dog, adopted by fellow traveler [Ben](http://www.kombilife.com) on his way from Chile to Alaska (the state). We met them in Anchorage and couldn't resist the charm of this furry lady.
