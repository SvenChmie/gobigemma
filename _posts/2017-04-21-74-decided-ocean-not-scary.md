I have terrible news! I asked Emma if we could stop parking by the ocean, and she said _No_, because all of Baja (that’s the part of Mexico we are in now) has an ocean around it! That’s horrible! So I asked if we could park not next to the ocean after Baja and she said that a lot of the way down to South America has ocean next to it, so I will have to park by the ocean a lot! I told her _That’s horrible, I’m going to rust away!_

Emma said she wouldn’t let me rust away. And she said they bought some stuff to put on me if I get any little rust spots, so the rust spots will not get bigger and hurt me.

So, I have decided I don’t want to seem silly in front of other buses that want to park next to the ocean. I am going to park even closer and I have decided it is not scary at all! No ocean will stop a Bus like me! Look, I got really close already!
