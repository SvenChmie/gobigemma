This is my friend Red Beard, he travels with [Bodes.well](https://www.instagram.com/bodes.well/). We go way back! All the way back to even before Emma and Sven (which is obviously really, really far!).

I used to live with Andres and Anna. They were the people who built all of my wood interior (they did it so well, didn’t they? My interior is so pretty!), and they lived in me and camped all over the place and had all sorts of adventures! They had a little human with them too. They even took me down to Mexico! And when we were in Mexico we camped with Red Beard, all those years ago. Emma said that must have been about seven years ago. I only met Emma and Sven about five years ago. It was really cool to see Red Beard again! We traded all sorts of stories about our adventures since we last met.

Andres and Anna had to go back across the ocean, like [Philipp](http://www.gobigemma.com/2017/01/23/40-went-new-human-phil-desert/) did. They lived there before they lived with me, so I understand that they wanted to go back. But I miss them sometimes, I really loved them. They are [family](http://www.gobigemma.com/2017/03/10/60-my-family/), too, I guess. But I am glad that when they had to leave, it made me find Emma and Sven, because I love them, too.
