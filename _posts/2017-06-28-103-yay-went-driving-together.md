Things are looking up! Emma said we are leaving Guadalahara really really soon! And then we will get to do adventures and camp and everything will be back to normal! I was afraid my humans would want to stay here _forever_. I’m glad they don’t because even if I do get to stay in the kitchen at night I don’t want to stay in stupid Guadalahara _forever_.

But we also went out to take an excursion! We drove around together for almost 5 hours! That’s a lot more time than they have spent with me since we got to this city.

We went to a place called _Tlalalacacpeke_ or something like that. It is funny, because it has houses with pigs that keep watch on the roof all the time. I told Sven we should get some pigs to keep watch on my roof, too.
