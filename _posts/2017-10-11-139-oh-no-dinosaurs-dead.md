I learned the most horrible thing! We went with Sven’s family to see this rock and I asked, _Emma, what is that rock for?_ And she said _It’s to remember all the dinosaurs._ 

So I asked her _What are dinosaurs?_ And she said that they were like animals, but really big, a lot bigger than cars! I said _Oh that sounds like an important animal, I should add it to [my list](http://gobigemma.de/2016/12/14/24-will-add-list/) in case I see one!_

But then Emma said, _Big Emma, you won’t see any dinosaurs, they are all dead!_ And I said _Oh no! So [are they Zombies](http://gobigemma.de/2017/08/23/127-emma-says-look-like-zombie/)?_ And Emma laughed and said there were no zombie dinosaurs. _But I bet the dinosaurs were great!_ I told her, _I wish they weren’t all dead._
