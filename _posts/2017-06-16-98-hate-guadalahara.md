Somebody broke into my triangle window! They opened it and bent the latch and took my toolbox! I told them NO THAT HAS EVERYTHING I NEED IN IT! YOU CAN’T HAVE THAT! But they didn’t care and took it anyways.

Humans are stupid. I hate it here in Guadalahara. I told Emma that we need to LEAVE. I’m NOT staying alone on the street here ANY more where I can’t even _see_ them. They need to be back camping with me and have hands to keep other humans away who want to steal my toolbox.

I told Emma and Sven that I hate humans and that I even don’t like them right now because they just left me outside on the street. And that tomorrow the first thing we are going to do is make a lock for my triangle windows. I don’t care what else they want to do.
