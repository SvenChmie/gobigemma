So I am finally done telling you all about my adventures in Mexico! I said goodbye to [Sven’s family](/gobigemma/2017/10/09/138-hello-svens-family-thank-breakfast) and then we went to a new country called Belize.

I was excited because we haven’t been to a new country in a long time! Emma said we would be going to new countries a lot more often now because they are smaller and it won’t take me as long to drive through them so we can get to Argentina.

I said, _Yay! Hello Belize!_ And then we crossed the border and Emma said we had to get something called insurance. I asked Emma _What is insurance?_ and she said it was a thing that cars needed in case they got into a crash. _Oh no I don’t want to get into any crashes! Why does Belize think I will do that?_ Emma said, _Well, all cars in Belize need insurance_. But I told her _I’m not like all cars_.
