Hi. My name is Big Emma. I’m...well I’m kind of a Bus. A VW Bus, the best kind of buses around (and don’t you forget it!). Sven and Emma always get to write things, why shouldn’t I, just because I’m a Bus? Buses need express themselves too, you know.

Anyways, this is me. I’m red and yellow, the best colors _ever_. Aren’t I beautiful? Sunshine always brings out my best angles. I have four wheels, and an engine. I go “meepmeep!” (and when I do, you better get out of the way. Or wave and meep back. Depending on what kind of meep, of course). What else can I say about me?

This is my diary, so I can just talk about _me_ all the time! Three times a week. That sounds like a good amount. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday I'll publish a new page of my diary. About _me_! Isn't that great? Man, there is just _sooo_ much to say about me! I could go on, like _all_ day. So this one time...
