Flashback to when we got our [window sticker](http://www.gobigemma.com/2016/08/13/adventure-1-road-rockies/) installed in Champaign, Illinois, when we were still preparing for our journey. As cool as it looked on paper, it was much more awesome on Big Emma's hatch window. It's always a cool surprise to get messages from people who saw us driving and knowing that our sticker is doing its job. It's been over a month since we hit the road, but wow, how time does fly.
