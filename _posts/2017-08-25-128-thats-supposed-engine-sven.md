_Sven, put that back!_ I told him the other day. _That’s my alternator and I can’t go anywhere at all with you just holding it like that._

Sven said my alternator was broken so I was getting a new one. But then the new one started smoking when he put it in so I said I wanted my old alternator back!

But Sven told me I couldn’t have my old one back and needed to use the new one, so he did all sorts of stuff with it and made sure it didn’t smoke anymore. He was right, it _does_ feel better than before! I told Sven, _You can keep the old one and install it so you could charge your_ human _battery!_ But he said that didn’t make any sense but I don’t know why.
